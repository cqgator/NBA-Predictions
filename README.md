# NBA Basketball Prediction Application (in Python)

*A Charlie Qualmann Production*

I love basketball and am also a nerd so I am always looking for ways to predict NBA games based on numbers, and now that it's playoffs season, I have finally started to code something I've wanted to make for a while. This project is still in its infancy, but the goal is to creat a tool to accurately and efficiently compare starging lineups and bench rotations from current NBA playoff teams and give a no-BS look into what team is expected to perform better. Many advanced statistics will be used.
